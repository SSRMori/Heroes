This is a small game that created by childishmori(Github) majors in computer science.
I use C++ as the language and I program it through the newest Visual Stdio 2017 Community.
For the project file is too big  because of some setting files for VS, I only uploaded my .h and .cpp files.
I believe this is enough to reconstructor this small game in your computer.

The main.cpp comtains only the main function ,which only has two helpful sentences and with no explanations.
The Hero.h and Hero.cpp contains the Hero class, Enemy class and the HeroManage class. 
It also contains some specified heroes class that extened from the Hero class.
The AttackEquipment.h and AttackEquipment.cpp contains the Equipment class, which is the parent class for any classes of equipments.
It also contains the AttackEquipment class that is extended from Equipment class.
And the same for DefenceEquipment class, which is in the DefenceEquipment.h and DefenceEquipment.cpp and is extended from Equipment class.
For the SynthesisEquipment, it is extended from both AttackEquipment and DefenceEquipment, and has a specific name for different heroes.

This game is a user-friendly game that use WASD or Dir-key to select options and Enter to comfirm your choice.
The functions SetConsoleCursorPosition and SetConsoleTextAttribute in Windows.h will be frequently used in this game.
For I do not have many experience in designing big project in C++, there may be some unreasonable places in this game.
So any question and suggestion is welcomed.
Please inform me if there is any bug when you running this game. 

This game tells a story of a land of monsters.
A brave young man, you, is chosen to save the world.
You have endless power and can summon a great ancient hero to help you.
You need to control your hero in a three-hero team to get through passes as many as you can.
There are three monsters in every pass. And the only thing you should do is to kill the monsters while keeping you and your teammate alive.
The monster you meet will be stronger and stronger, and so are you.
You will be stronger with equipments that got from monsters you have killed.
And you can use 5 equipments to synthesis a powerful weapon that will give you endless power and unlock your special skill.
Remember, every hero is alive and they will behave different when you choose the same step.
They will speak to you to show their personalities.
So, please treasure them and enjoy your journey of saving the world.

And I shall stop there and give you the chance to try this game.
More functions can be found when playing.
Wish you have a good day!
